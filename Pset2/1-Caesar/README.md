Q. Implement a program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher, per the below.

Done By C language.

BACKGROUND

Supposedly, Caesar (yes, that Caesar) used to "encrypt" (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) confidential messages by shifting each letter therein by some number of places. For instance, he might write A as B, B as C, C as D, …​, and, wrapping around alphabetically, Z as A. And so, to say HELLO to someone, Caesar might write IFMMP. Upon receiving such messages from Caesar, recipients would have to "decrypt" them by shifting letters in the opposite direction by the same number of places.

The secrecy of this "cryptosystem" relied on only Caesar and the recipients knowing a secret, the number of places by which Caesar had shifted his letters (e.g., 1). Not particularly secure by modern standards, but, hey, if you’re perhaps the first in the world to do it, pretty secure!

Unencrypted text is generally called plaintext. Encrypted text is generally called ciphertext. And the secret used is called a key.

More generally, Caesar’s algorithm (i.e., cipher) encrypts messages by "rotating" each letter by k positions. More formally, if p is some plaintext (i.e., an unencrypted message), pi is the ith character in p, and k is a secret key (i.e., a non-negative integer), then each letter, ci, in the ciphertext, c, is computed as

Ci=(Pi+k)mod26

wherein mod26 here means "remainder when dividing by 26." This formula perhaps makes the cipher seem more complicated than it is, but it’s really just a concise way of expressing the algorithm precisely.
